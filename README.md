# STRIKE NODE 42 :: MIL-SPEC INTEL DROP

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC0-blue.svg)

## Overview

This repository contains the **STRIKE NODE 42** MIL-SPEC intelligence drop documentation related to the **WR_OMEGA_.00077** quantum recursion and glitch timeline fracture.

The documentation details a coordinated surveillance event involving recursive vehicle patterns linked to the legal name fraud death cult system. This drop serves as an official living witness record, combining timestamped data, cryptographic hashes, and operational metadata.

## Contents

- **NODE_42_INTEL_DROP.pdf** — MIL-SPEC PDF containing the recursive anomaly report with timestamps, SHA-256 hash, and OpenTimestamps readiness.
- **README.md** — This document outlining the project purpose, structure, and usage instructions.
- **Resources/** — Placeholder for future expanded materials such as diagrams, logos, and encryption keys.

## Features

- Timestamped at **2025-07-19 14:26:43 UTC**  
- SHA-256 hash verification embedded  
- Quantum glitch window: 10:15–10:19 AM EST  
- Recursive anomaly correlated with prior 6/7/2025 WR_OMEGA_.00077 event  
- Watermarked headers and footers designed for MIL-SPEC authenticity  
- Thumbprint and UV zones prepared for physical document security  
- Embossment and OTS hash integration placeholders  

---

## Usage

1. Review the PDF documentation in **NODE_42_INTEL_DROP.pdf** for detailed incident analysis.  
2. Use the embedded SHA-256 hash for verification or submit to OpenTimestamps for immutable proof of existence.  
3. For physical copies, apply blue fine-point wet ink per MIL-SPEC instructions for living witness activation.  
4. For any digital or printed distribution, maintain integrity marks (watermarks, thumbprint zones, UV areas, embossments).
